NEIGHBORHOOD MAP PROJECT
This project shows at least 5 places on a map as markers, that I like in the city of Gramado-RS. It also shows a list on the left panel.

REQUISITS:
- Download the project in your preferred folder.
- Just load the index.html in your browser, preferrebly on Chrome.
- The app uses Google Maps and Foursquare API.

HOW IT WORKS:
- Default and Initial view: A list of all places on the left panel, and the map centered in Gramado, shows the markers from those places.
- Click on a marker and it will show the infoWindow with a description of that place.
- If you click on the name of the place on the list on the left it will have the same effect.
- FILTER: if you type some text on the Text Input above the list from the panel and click the "Filter" Button, it will show only the places that contain the text you typed on their titles. It will filter the list and the map.
- Note that you have to click "Filter", unless it will not work.
- Also, if you want to clear the filter (show all places), just clear the Input Text Box, and click Filter again.
